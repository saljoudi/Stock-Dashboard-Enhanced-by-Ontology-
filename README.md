ðŸ§  Ontology Architecture Overview
The ontology is essentially a knowledge-based system that understands relationships between technical indicators and can provide intelligent insights beyond just displaying charts.

ðŸ”§ Core Components of the Ontology
1. Structured Knowledge Base
python
self.indicators = {
    'trend': {
        'SMA': {
            'periods': [5, 20, 50, 200],
            'relationships': {
                'golden_cross': {'fast': 50, 'slow': 200},
                'death_cross': {'fast': 50, 'slow': 200}
            },
            'significance': 'Primary trend identification'
        },
        # ... more indicators with their properties
    }
}
What this does:

Organizes indicators into logical categories (trend, momentum, volume, etc.)

Defines relationships between indicators (e.g., golden cross = 50 SMA crosses above 200 SMA)

Stores significance and interpretation rules for each indicator

2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis Framework
The ontology performs analysis across four key dimensions:

A. Trend Analysis (enhanced_trend_analysis)
python
def enhanced_trend_analysis(self, df):
    # Multi-timeframe analysis
    short_term_bullish = (current_price > SMA_20 and current_price > EMA_8)
    medium_term_bullish = (current_price > SMA_50)
    long_term_bullish = (current_price > SMA_200)
    
    # ADX trend strength
    if adx > 25: 
        signals.append("Strong Trend")
        confidence_score += 2
How it works:

Timeframe Integration: Analyzes short (5-20), medium (50), and long-term (200) trends

Trend Strength: Uses ADX to quantify trend strength (weak/moderate/strong)

Confidence Scoring: Assigns points based on trend alignment across timeframes

B. Momentum Analysis (enhanced_momentum_analysis)
python
def enhanced_momentum_analysis(self, df):
    # RSI analysis
    if rsi > 70:
        signals.append("RSI Overbought")
        momentum_score -= 1
    elif rsi < 30:
        signals.append("RSI Oversold") 
        momentum_score += 1
    
    # MACD analysis
    if macd > signal:
        signals.append("MACD Bullish")
        momentum_score += 1
How it works:

Multiple Momentum Indicators: Combines RSI, MACD, Stochastic, CCI

Overbought/Oversold Detection: Identifies extreme conditions

Signal Confluence: Looks for agreement between different momentum indicators

C. Volume Analysis (enhanced_volume_analysis)
python
def enhanced_volume_analysis(self, df):
    # OBV confirmation/divergence
    obv_trend = obv_current > obv_prev
    price_trend = price_current > price_prev
    
    if obv_trend and price_trend:
        signals.append("OBV Confirming Uptrend")
        volume_score += 2
    elif obv_trend != price_trend:
        signals.append("OBV Divergence Detected")
        volume_score -= 1
How it works:

Volume-Price Relationship: Checks if volume confirms price moves

Money Flow Analysis: Uses CMF to detect buying/selling pressure

Divergence Detection: Identifies when volume and price disagree

D. Volatility & Support/Resistance Analysis
python
def volatility_analysis(self, df):
    atr_percent = (atr / current_price) * 100
    if atr_percent > 5:
        signals.append("High Volatility")
How it works:

Volatility Assessment: Uses ATR to measure market volatility

Key Level Detection: Identifies nearby support/resistance levels

Risk Evaluation: Classifies volatility as low/medium/high

ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Decision Making
3. Confidence Scoring System
python
def generate_advanced_summary(self, df):
    trend_signals, trend_score = self.enhanced_trend_analysis(df)      # 0-10 points
    momentum_signals, momentum_score = self.enhanced_momentum_analysis(df) # 0-8 points  
    volume_signals, volume_score = self.enhanced_volume_analysis(df)   # 0-6 points
    
    total_score = trend_score + momentum_score + volume_score
    confidence_percentage = (total_score / 24) * 100  # Max 24 points
Scoring Logic:

Trend: Up to 10 points based on multi-timeframe alignment and ADX strength

Momentum: Up to 8 points based on RSI, MACD, Stochastic signals

Volume: Up to 6 points based on OBV confirmation and money flow

4. Market Regime Detection
python
def detect_market_regime(self, df):
    if adx > 25:
        if price > SMA_50:
            return "Trending Bull"
        else:
            return "Trending Bear"
    else:
        return "Ranging/Low Volatility"
Regime Classification:

Trending Bull: Strong uptrend with ADX > 25 and price above medium-term MA

Trending Bear: Strong downtrend with ADX > 25 and price below medium-term MA

Ranging: Weak trends (ADX < 25), sideways movement

5. Risk Assessment Framework
python
def assess_risk_level(self, df):
    risk_factors = []
    atr_ratio = atr / current_price
    
    if atr_ratio > 0.05:
        risk_factors.append("High Volatility")
    elif atr_ratio > 0.02:
        risk_factors.append("Medium Volatility")
Risk Factors Monitored:

Volatility Risk: Based on ATR percentage

Trend Risk: Based on trend strength and consistency

Volume Risk: Based on volume confirmation/divergence

Regular Bearish Divergence: Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high

Regular Bullish Divergence: Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low

Volume Divergence: Price and OBV move in opposite directions

When trend, momentum, AND volume all align bullishly â†’ High confidence

When indicators conflict â†’ Lower confidence, caution recommended
